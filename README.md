# The Brightbox Deployment Gem

This pair of gems make up the [Brightbox](http://www.brightbox.co.uk/)
Rails deployment system. They provide some server-side tools for
managing configuration and some [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/)
recipes for coordinating the actual deployment.

Full documentation is available on the
[Brightbox wiki](http://wiki.brightbox.co.uk/docs:gemv2:start).
