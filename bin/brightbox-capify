    ## Local Shared Area

    # server. It uses the same shared area as the log files.
    #
    # NOTE: local areas trump global areas, allowing you to have some
    # servers using local assets if required.
    #
    # So if you have an 'upload' directory in public, add 'public/upload'
    # to the :local_shared_dirs array.
    # If you want to share the database.yml add 'config/database.yml'
    # to the :local_shared_files array.
    #
    # The shared area is prepared with 'deploy:setup' and all the shared
    # items are symlinked in when the code is updated.
    # set :local_shared_dirs, %w(public/upload)
    # set :local_shared_files, %w(config/database.yml)
    
    ## Global Shared Area
    # These are the list of files and directories that you want
    # to share between all releases of your application across all servers.
    # For it to work you need a directory on a network file server shared
    # between all your servers. Specify the path to the root of that area
    # in :global_shared_path. Defaults to the same value as :shared_path.
    # set :global_shared_path, "/srv/share/myapp"
    #
    # NOTE: local areas trump global areas, allowing you to have some
    # servers using local assets if required.
    #
    # Beyond that it is the same as the local shared area.
    # So if you have an 'upload' directory in public, add 'public/upload'
    # to the :global_shared_dirs array.
    # If you want to share the database.yml add 'config/database.yml'
    # to the :global_shared_files array.
    #
    # The shared area is prepared with 'deploy:setup' and all the shared
    # items are symlinked in when the code is updated.

    ## Static asset caching.
    # By default static assets served directly by the web server are
    # cached by the client web browser for 10 years, and cache invalidation
    # of static assets is handled by the Rails helpers using asset
    # timestamping.

    # assets, or other special cache requirements. The value is in seconds.

    ## Logrotation
    # Where the logs are stored. Defaults to <shared_path>/log

    # Which version control system. Defaults to subversion if there is
    # no 'set :scm' command.

    # make sure you set the :runner variable - which is the user the
    # capistrano default tasks use to execute commands.
